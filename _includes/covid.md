## COVID-19 Considerations

This event will only proceed if Dunedin is under Alert level 1 or 2 onwards from Sunday 21st November.  

Should Dunedin be operating under the COVID-19 protection framework (traffic light system), COVID-19 vaccination certificates may be required.

Key points:
- If you are sick don't come
- QR scanning or manual sign-ins are required
- Masks will be worn
- Use hand-sanitiser regularly
- Maintain social distancing (Uni guidelines say 2m for those outside your normal work building/bubble + mask)

### Travel from outside Dunedin

From the current guidelines if you are travelling from outside of Dunedin:

As at 21st November:

- Current location is Alert level 1 or 2 = come along
- Current location is Alert level 3 or 4 = stay home as inter-regional travel isn't allowed
